<!-- To keep pre-registrations to a reasonable length for readers, we recommend answers fit within a single page .pdf document, roughly 3200 characters. Read more about this here: https://aspredicted.org/messages/why_limits.php -->

## Data collection

<!-- Have any data been collected for this study already? (Note: "Yes" is not an accepted answer.) -->

Yes, we already collected the data.

## Hypothesis

<!-- What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study? -->

This project aims to address two questions qualitatively:

-   Does abundance of Plethodon cinereus change between 2004 and 2019 in Bruce Peninsula National Park?
-   Do abundance trends differ between the two P. cinereus colour morphs (redback and leadback)?

Some useful sources (@noÃ«l2007, @wiggins2011).

## Dependent variable

<!-- Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured. -->

Salamander abundance is the dependent variable. To collect this metric, the number of *P. cinereus* individuals are counted in multiple plots in Bruce Peninsula National Park.


## Analyses

<!-- Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. -->

I will qualitatively examine the effect of soil temperature (in degrees Celsius) on salamander abundance, and see if this relationship differs between the two *P. cinereus* colour morphs. I will visually examine this relationship using a scatterplot fitted with a linear model.

## Outliers and exclusions

<!-- Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations. -->

I will only exclude NA values.

## Study type

This pre-registration is for a class project.
