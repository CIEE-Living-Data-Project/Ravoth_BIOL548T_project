# This sets up the format to match most journal requirements of 1" margins
# and 12pt Times new Roman font. The catch is that to specify the font
# you have to use the xelatex latex_engine. Also important to note, most 
# journals need Word files (or Latex) for copy editing. You can simply
# comment out lines (20, 21, 23 and 24) and uncomment the 
# word_document output.

# Abstract

*Plethodon cinereus* salamanders exist in Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, Canada. I downloaded data to analyse how colour morph affects the relationship between soil temperature (degrees Celsius) and abundance. I produced one figure.

**Key-words**: salamanders, abundance, temperature

\newpage

# Introduction

I used some references in this project (@noÃ«l2007, @wiggins2011).

# Methods

I did some funky things in R!

# Results

There is not qualitative relationship between *P. cinereus* abundance and soil temperature for both colour morph (Figure 1).

Some smart discussion here.
