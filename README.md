## BIOL548T (Productivity & Reproducibility in Ecology & Evolution project, LDP) project.

In this project, I analyse abundance data of two redback salamander colour morphs (Plethodon cinereus) collected from Bruce Peninsula National Park. This data was collected between May 2004 and June 2019.

Redback salamanders are fascinating research subjects due to their long lifespans, high site fidelity, and small home ranges! They respire cutaneously, and are therefore useful indicators of environmental quality (e.g., air or water pollutants).

This repo contains all data, scripts, outputs, documents, and tutorial materials associated with building this project. Please see this project on OSF for additional details, such as references (https://osf.io/gs9pj/?view_only=20085e3c0f744ee8835e29bef7ca17eb).
