### Author: Sarah Ravoth

In this project, I analyse abundance data of two redback salamander (*Plethodon cinereus*) colour morphs collected from Bruce Peninsula National Park. This data was collected between May 2004 and June 2019.

Redback salamanders are fascinating research subjects due to their long lifespans, high site fidelity, and small home ranges! They respire cutaneously, and are therefore useful indicators of environmental quality (e.g., air or water pollutants).

This repo contains all data, scripts, outputs, documents, and tutorial materials associated with building this project. Please see this project on OSF for additional details, such as references (https://osf.io/gs9pj/?view_only=20085e3c0f744ee8835e29bef7ca17eb). 

### Usage

R scripts to perform this project are located in the **scripts** folder. The tidying script is available to view or replicate tidying steps taken on the raw data. However, the figure script can be run without the user tidying first, as it accesses a seperate tidied file. To view the final figure, see the **outputs** folder. To view regregistration and manuscript, see the **documents** folder. To view data files, see the **data** folder. To see tutorial materials that helped in developing this project, see the **tutorials** folder.
